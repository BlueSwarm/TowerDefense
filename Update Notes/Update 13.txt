In this update we add something that I kinda forgot about. It is a critical point that defines the tower defense
genre and we were missing it. We didn't have any credits! We had unlimited tower placement and no rewards for killing
enemies. So we took care of that!

There is also a new version of Unity out, so the project got upgraded into that.

We have in general a lot of scripts that got updated for the credits. For example, GeneralMapLogic holds a public static
variable that stores the credits, while in AILife when we are about to destroy the object, we add a small amount to our
credits!

So, makes sure to check the committed files list and get to see everything. If you have something to say/ask/suggest
make sure to open an issue (or sent a mail or whatever).
