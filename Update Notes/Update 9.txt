In Update 9 we complete the first phase of community mapping.

Again, I love Arrowgamer. He got me in touch with JSON, which we use to store our maps
and there is a really good explanation about the whole map exporting in ExportMap.cs.

Make sure to read "Map Exporting Instructions" before using the script!

Feel free to Pull Request your maps :)

As always, ask me anything you want. Next update we will finish with maps and move on to
the main menu. Before I do that though, I will explain my vision of the main menu, like I
did with map storing.
