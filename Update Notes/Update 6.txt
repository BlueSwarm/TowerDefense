This must be the smaller update on this project so far!

We just added a spawner with his working script.
The script is really simple and it was something new for me as well!
I never tried adding children before through script and see how the 
Unity engine handles it. It turns out, really well! That's a cool feature.

You almost have anything you need in order to make your own maps (if you want).
The last few main things we need before the polish are the core and a way
to determine if we won or lose.

As always, if you have anything to ask/suggest/say, visit the issues section.
