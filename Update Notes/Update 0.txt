From now on, I will include detailed commments in my scripts.
Start with the CameraMovement.cs located in Assets/Scripts.

As I mentioned in an Issue/Comment, most of the files you see are
created by the engine itself. The only things I added so far
are 2 scripts and 1 saved scene.

The scene just saves all the game objects and their attributes.

In general, the new content will always be located in the
Assets folder. If I place something in a different folder,
I will mention it.

Please, read the the comments in the scripts and if you have any 
issues, please open an issue and I will be sure to reply.
