There are a lot of stuff to check out.

For starters, I removed the build folder. As I said, I won't
commit any excecutables.

I made a change in CameraZoom.cs in order to make the speed
more reasonable! The issue was that when you get an axis input,
the return value will always be between -1 and 1. That means,
we lower the speed by multiplying it with the result!

I made a prefab of a tower holder. This is going to be placed,
anywhere we need tower places on the map. Together with the prefab,
I made 2 scripts. HolderUtilities.cs, which is going to hold
all the functions we need to control the holder from other scripts
and SpawnTower.cs, which checks the mouse for clicks and sents
a message to the holder that we clicked, saying that we want to
spawn a tower there.

I also made a few simple color materials and changed the shaders
from default difuse to cartoon.

As always, if anyone has any question, submit an issue. I'll be happy
to help as soon as I can.
