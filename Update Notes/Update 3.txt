Another small update.

This time I created a new prefab called Tower.

For now it's just a simple rectangle cube that does nothing
but teting our functions!

Looks like the spawn and remove functions of the game works
fine. If anyone tries out and discover some bugs, please let
me know. Please check the HolderUtilities script, if you want to
see how we instantiate a prefab in the game!

I added a new script called PrefabChest. It will hold all the
prefabs so that any script that wants to access one, can simply
grab it from the chest.

Next time, a simple map, enemies and towers shooting at them!!!
