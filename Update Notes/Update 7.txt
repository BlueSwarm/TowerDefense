We are pretty much done with the mechanics!

I added a core and a way to understand what is going on with the game. Are we
still going? Did we win? Did we lose?

I have to admit that I had a hard time making the core work because the enemies
couldn't trigger his collision script. But in the end I made it a trigger
like the projectiles and it worked.

So, I suggest taking a look at the new scripts and the small changes in the old
ones. You can see what files have been changed/added under this commit, but I
will list them here:

AISpawner
GeneralMapLogic
CoreLife

Now I want to work on making a simple main menu and it would be nice to have
a way to store maps in files. Scenes work alright but you have to add them
in a list before making a build. So, a main menu and map storing. After these
things are done, I will make a tutorial on how to make maps. It would be nice
to have a map pack in which everyone that follows this example project can 
contribute. You can probably work out how to make your own map by looking at the
test scene but I feel the need to make that tutorial. As you can see, there are 
a lot of things to come and I feel excited!
