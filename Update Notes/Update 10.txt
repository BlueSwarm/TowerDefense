NOTE: There are some bugs I found out at the last minute with the spawner
and it will be fixed first thing next update. The bug won't stop you from
creating and publishing maps.



Today we finish up with map importing! We can now read the .dat map files we were able
to create in the last update and succesfully re create the map at runtime! Hooray!

The ImportMap scene is a plain scene, as you will see, with an importer. He only
has our ImportMap.cs script. You should check it out. The script is really simple
and was just a hussle to write (lots of checks and stuff).

Next stop is the main menu. As I promised, here is my vision of it:

Top right -> 2 Buttons (Play, Exit)
From top left to just before the buttons start -> A list with all the maps found
						  in the Maps folder.

Clicking on a map, selects it and if you hit play it goes in the ImportMap scene,
where we load the map!

It is a pretty simple layout. It's just that I haven't tried doing a list
in the Unity GUI yet.

So! If you think my layout is faulty, or you have another idea, feel free to open an issue.

As always, if you have anything to ask/tell me, just do it!
