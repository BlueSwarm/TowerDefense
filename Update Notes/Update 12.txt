In this update we add a script that takes care of our exit plans, after we finished playing
a level.

Make sure to check EndSequence.cs under Assets/Scripts/Map Logic/
Another script to check would be GeneralMapLogic.cs for the way we call our new script.

I also removed the JSON library that we didn't use at all.

As always guys, if you have anything to say, open an issue and I'll repsond as soon as
I see it.
