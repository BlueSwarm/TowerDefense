First of all, I didn't make everything I said I would do on my last update.

I did make a really simple map, so we have that.

I added a scene that will show you how the enemy ai moves.
I wasn't sure how to implement an ai system, but then it hit me.
The purpose of this project is to make everything simple and understanable.
It's the base for something greater. So, the ai is pretty simple as well!

If you open the scene in the editor, you will notice a new game object called
"AI Path". It's children are nodes. A node is a game object with only a transform
attached to it.

Now, if you open up the new AIMovement script, under Assets/Scripts/AI/,
you'll notice the lack of comments. I am going to explain everything here,
because the code itself doesn't need much explanation.

The way the ai works is as simple as this: Right after the enemy spawns,
he looks for the first node. When he finds that node, he moves towards it.
transform.LookAt (target) does exactly what it says. It changes the rotation
to face our target. Our target of course is the node. After the enemy reaches
the node, he looks for the next node. This goes until we don't have another node
to go to, which means our path is over and we reached our destination. Then,
we simply destroy the enemy. Later on, we will inform the game that the enemy
reached the end.

We are almost done with the basics of the game. We just need the towers to shoot,
a victory/defeat scenario and that's it! The rest will be just content like,
extra towers, enemies, maps.

I really hope everything is clear to everytone that follows this project.
If you have any problems, please let me know in the issue section.
