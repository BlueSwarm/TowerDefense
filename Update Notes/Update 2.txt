A smaller update this time.

Added a gui script under Assets/GUI/Scripts.
Made changes in the SpawnTower and HolderUtilities scripts.

The game now recognizes when we spawn a tower and when we 
remove one.

Added an exit script. Escape is the exit key now.

Next time I will create a tower prefab and add it into the game.

Be sure to check the new and old scripts. If there are any issues
please let me know in the Issue section.
