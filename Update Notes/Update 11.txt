Here for once we get an update sooner that it was expected!

I finished up the main menu with it's appearance and it's functionality.
You should go check the SimpleMenuGUI.cs script under GUI/Scripts.

Some really small changes:
	GeneralMapGUI - Added map name label on the top right of the screen.
	ImportMap - No need to set the map name in the Start function. Left it in a
		    comment in case we want to test without going through the menu.
	AISpanwer - Changed on how we check if we spawned the right amount of enemies.
	     	    Before the change, it would check if "perWave" enemies were in
		    the scene. This didn't work if we had a lot of towers and the
		    enemies died right away. Now we check it as it should have been
		    and fixed that bug.

Som what's next? The only crucial thing left to implement is the exit strategy. What
happens when we win/lose. After this is done, we will have the base done. I am
considering to expand it even more with more custom content. It will be that or I will
take on another project. We'll see!
