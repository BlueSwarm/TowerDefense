TowerDefense
============

A tower defense prototype in Unity3D.

This is going to be a simple tower defense game, with fixed tower placement positions, pretty much like Defense Grid.
Everything that I implement will be explained in detail. So, this project will be like an example for Unity3D.

I don't have a lot of experience with the engine or with making a tower defense game, so I will be learning stuff as well.

If you got any question, leave it in the issues section. I'd be happy to help.
