After you are done creating your map and you a similar layout with the test map
(same game object names), add the ExportMap script on MapLogic. Then, go in Play Mode
and you'll notice that there are not enemies spawning. That's a good thing. The script,
prevents any automatic game creation so that we can keep the map at it's pure form.
After a little while (1-2 seconds) you can stop Play Mode. There should be a file with the
name of your scene under the Maps folder. That's the only file you need right now.
